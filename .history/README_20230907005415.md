### 1) What is SDLC? What is the SDLC process?

SDLC is an abbreviation for "Software Development Life Cycle". SDLC is the process of systematic development of software by following every step in the development process. The entire process may involve different software development methodologies. SDLC is useful for improving the quality of software and ensuring the software properly meets user expectations.

### 2) What are the different phases involved in the SDLC process?
SDLC approach is used to design or develop software in a systematic manner. Following are the phases involved in an SDLC process:

* Planning or Requirement Analysis
* System Design
* Development
* Coding
* Testing
* Deployment and Maintenance

### 3) What is the initial phase of SDLC?
The initial phase of the software development life cycle is referred to as "Planning or Requirement Analysis”. It means that the developers figure out the basic requirements of the project and build a plan to achieve that approach. There are several factors such as technical, economic, and operational feasibility which are carried out in the initial phase. The possible risks and other unexpected circumstances that could be a part of the software project are also discussed in this phase.

### 4) What is the feasibility study? Who does it?
The feasibility study is one of the important factors of the software development life cycle. It allows assessing how viable and beneficial software project development will be for any organization. The software analyst is responsible to perform a complete study to understand the technical, economic, and operational feasibility of any project.

Technical: Under the technical study, it is measured whether the system can be developed according to the requirements. The study also includes the suitability of devices and operating systems for running the software. Tools and utilities required for the project are also reviewed in the technical study.

Economic: All economic factors such as resource transportation, training costs, tools and utility costs, and other costs and benefits are estimated under economic feasibility.

Operational: The operational study allows us to measure whether the organization will adjust properly according to the changes made as per the demand of the software project. The study also includes whether the change is useful.

### 5) What is the design phase in SDLC?
In the design phase, the basic structure for the development of the software is designed according to the software requirement specification (SRS). The requirements and other details are documented in a DDS (Design Document Specification). The requirements are further converted into a logical structure and implemented in software through a specific programming language. The design phase is the most challenging phase of the software development life cycle. 

### 6) What is mean by SRS?
SRS stands for “Software Requirement Specification”. It is typically a document that is generated at the time of requirement gathering. SRS is referred to as an agreement between the developer and the customer containing all the functional and non-functional requirements of the software to be developed. SRS works as an input for the software design phase. It is built with the proper communication between Business Analysts, client, and the technical team.

Functional Requirements: Functional requirements are the functional features and specifications that a user expects from the software.

Functional Requirements: Functional requirements are the functional features and specifications that a user expects from the software.

Non-functional Requirements: Non-functional requirements include security, performance, user interface design, interoperability, cost, etc. expected by users from the software.

### 7) State the importance of the Coding phase.
In the coding phase of SDLC, the design document is converted into an executable programming language. This means that the actual programming or coding for the development of the software is performed in this phase according to SRS and DDS. Based on the requirements, the programming language is selected like Java, Python, or C#, etc.

This phase is said to be the longest phase of the software development life cycle. The output obtained from the coding phase acts as the input of the test phase.

### 8) What is the testing phase of SDLC?
Prior to deployment of software, programming, or code is tested against DDS to ensure that the software is actually performing according to the specifications addressed during the requirements analysis phase. During the testing phase, various types of tests are done such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing, etc. The software testing team works closely with developers to detect and resolve software bugs, which may have occurred in the previous phase. The entire software is retested until it meets the specified requirements outlined in SRS.

Nowadays, there are advanced testing tools that allow firms or organizations to test software for selected custom requirements.
